# ALCOP Dx Audio Options

## The Problem
- **Sub-optimal audio quality from shoot**
  - Loud location noise floor  
  - Poor boom mic positioning  
- **Combined Dialogue & SFX**
  - Current picture edit has a single mixed-down track with both DX & SFX  

---

## The Goal
- **OPTION A (Ideal):** Obtain a clean, mix-ready DX track fully separated from SFX  
- **OPTION B (Fallback):** Suppress noise/artifacts on the combined DX/SFX track for improved intelligibility

## Potential Solutions — OPTION A

### 1. AI-Based Separation (Emerging Products)
- **AudioShake – Dialogue, Music & Effects**
  - Studio-grade AI separation; trusted by Disney and other majors  
  - [audioshake.ai](https://www.audioshake.ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
  - Cost: **$20–$99/mo (Indie)**; **enterprise: $2K–$5K per feature**  
  - Trial: Free Indie tier (2 stems/mo), enterprise demo available  

- **Moises – Multimedia Tracks**
  - Separates Dialogue, Soundtrack, and Effects stems  
  - [moises.ai](https://moises.ai/features/multimedia-tracks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
  - Cost: **$6/mo (Premium)** to **$30/mo (Pro)**  
  - Trial: Free tier (5 separations/mo) + Premium trial  

- **Music AI – Cinematic Stems**
  - Purpose-built for DX/MX/FX separation in film/TV pipelines  
  - [music.ai](https://music.ai/modules/stem-separation/cinematic-stems/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
  - Cost: **$0.05/minute processed (~$5 per feature)**  
  - Trial: Demo on request  

**Pros:**  
- Fast turnaround vs. manual re-edit  
- Useful for localization, temp mixes  
- Predictable pricing  

**Cons:**  
- Tech not fully proven for big-budget features  
- Potential artifacts / phasing issues  
- Licensing varies (AudioShake safest enterprise option)

### 2. Manual Re-Edit from Source DX
- **Tools:** Pro Tools, iZotope RX  
- **Labor:** ~20–40 hrs per reel (100–200 hrs per feature)  
- **Pros:** Cleanest, least AI artifacts  
- **Cons:** Extremely time/labor intensive; higher cost  

---

### 3. Use Pre-Separated “Angelo / SD1” Tracks
- **Noise Reduction / Clean-Up Tools:** iZotope RX, Acon DeNoise, Adobe Enhance Speech, Klevgrand Brusfri, Waves Clarity Vx Pro, CrumplePop Clean Audio AI  
- **Editing Platforms:** Pro Tools, DaVinci Resolve  

**Pros:**  
- Faster than full re-edit  
- Uses existing track structure  

**Cons:**  
- Quality degradation risk  
- Noise reduction introduces artifacts if pushed  

---

## Potential Solutions — OPTION B

### 1. Artifact-Suppressed DX/SFX Track
- **Tools:** Pro Tools + iZotope RX  
- **Approach:** Work only on mixed track; suppress noise/artifacts as much as possible  

**Pros:**  
- Quick, low labor hours  

**Cons:**  
- Artifacts remain  
- Intelligibility limits  
- Restricted final mix flexibility  

---

## Additional Considerations
- **Licensing / Legal:** Enterprise-grade AI tools (e.g. AudioShake Live) provide IP indemnification; consumer tools may not.  
- **Export Fidelity:** Ensure delivery spec (48kHz/24bit WAV min). Some AI defaults to MP3 unless upgraded.  
- **QC Passes:** Expect 2–3 passes per reel for pro deliverables, tripling per-minute costs.  
- **Cost per Reel:**  
  - AudioShake Live: ~$400–$1,000  
  - Moises Pro: Flat $30/mo (covers full feature)  
  - Music AI: ~$1 per reel (~$5 per feature, single pass)
